This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB bug involving an unexpected empty array being returned from a function. The bug arises from a conditional statement within the `myFunction` function where the function returns an empty array in certain cases. This can lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the code that call `myFunction`. The solution shows how to handle the empty array return more robustly.
